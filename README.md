# IFT3355-walking_robot
    Done in the contet of the IFT 3355 course at UdeM, this project aims to make a 3d robot and make it move ~from scratch with rotation and translation matrix.
    
    Have to make walk animation and more.


## problems encountered
 - torso in the right position but whole body flying torso.y + 2 over it
 - not reading the assignment well enough


## Parent problem
    As the assignment says, "creating a hierarchy using the 'parent' attribute isn't allowed, this greatly hindered my code and I stand firm as to how it shouldn't be a restriction but I don't have the final word as to what my grade will be and won't risk it

    So, i will be using a similar approach, hardcoding the "papa"(parent) for every case (see anchor_rotate in utils.js and lines ~280-340 in A1.js)
